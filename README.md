# proseGeek

proseGeek is a plug-in for Sublime Text 3 that helps writers to analyze their texts. Current features include:

* Assess the lexical diversity of the text
* Identify the shortest and longest sentences
* Identify most commonly used words, bigrams and trigrams

This plugin requires that [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/) and [beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) libraries are installed prior to its use.
